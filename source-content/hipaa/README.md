# HIPAA Security Rule — Manual Supply Required

## Why this directory is empty

The HIPAA Security Rule is published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is **freely available**. However, an automated downloader for this framework has not yet been implemented in comply-with-me.

## How to obtain

Download directly from HHS:

- [HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html)
- [HIPAA Security Rule Summary](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html)
- NIST SP 800-66r2 (HIPAA implementation guidance): download via comply-with-me's NIST downloader

## What to place here

Drop the PDF files into this directory. Suggested filenames:

- `hipaa-security-rule.pdf`
- `hipaa-security-rule-summary.pdf`

Once placed, these files will be picked up by the normalize command (when available).

> **Note:** A future version of comply-with-me may automate this download.
