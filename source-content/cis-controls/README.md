# CIS Controls v8 — Manual Supply Required

## Why this directory is empty

CIS Controls v8 is published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The full controls document is **free to download but requires registration** on the CIS website. Because registration is required, comply-with-me cannot automate the download without credentials.

## How to obtain

1. Create a free account at [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/)
2. Download **CIS Controls v8** from the [CIS Controls page](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list)

## What to place here

Drop the PDF files into this directory. Suggested filenames:

- `cis-controls-v8.pdf`
- `cis-controls-v8-guide.pdf`

The CIS also publishes Implementation Group mappings and companion documents — those can be placed here as well.

Once placed, these files will be picked up by the normalize command (when available).
