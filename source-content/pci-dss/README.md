# PCI DSS v4.0 — Manual Supply Required

## Why this directory is empty

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) v4.0 is published by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). The documents are **free to download but require registration** on the PCI SSC website. Because registration is required, comply-with-me cannot automate the download without credentials.

## How to obtain

1. Create a free account at [PCI SSC Document Library](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/)
2. Download **PCI DSS v4.0** and any supplemental guidance you need

## What to place here

Drop the PDF files into this directory. Suggested filenames:

- `pci-dss-v4.0.pdf`
- `pci-dss-v4.0-quick-reference-guide.pdf`

Once placed, these files will be picked up by the normalize command (when available).
