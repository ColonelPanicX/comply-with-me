# SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria — Manual Supply Required

## Why this directory is empty

The SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (TSC) is published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The 2017 TSC document (updated 2022) is **not freely available** — it requires an AICPA membership or purchase.
